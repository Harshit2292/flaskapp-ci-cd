3. Download the appropriate file for your system.

## 📂 System Requirements
Before you start, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or a compatible Linux distribution.
- **Docker:** Install Docker to build and run container images for the Flask app.
- **AWS Account:** Create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account for deployment to EC2.
- **Git:** Git is needed to clone repositories.

## ⚙️ Installation Steps
Once you have downloaded the application, follow these steps to install and run it:

1. Extract the downloaded file to a location on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.

4. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```
   docker build -t flaskapp .
   ```

5. After the build finishes, run the Docker container with this command:

   ```
   docker run -p 5000:5000 flaskapp
   ```

6. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view your Flask app.

## 📊 How It Works
- **Continuous Integration:** As you push changes to your code, automated tests will run to ensure your app works as expected.
- **Continuous Deployment:** When your code passes all tests, the application gets deployed automatically to AWS EC2.
- **Docker:** This application uses Docker to ensure consistent runs across different environments.

## 🛠️ Features
- Automated testing to catch issues early.
- Docker support for easy application packaging.
- Smooth integration with Docker Hub for image storage.
- Automatic deployment to AWS EC2.
- Clean and simple interface for users.

## 💡 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

- **If Docker fails to install:** Ensure your system supports virtual machines, as Docker relies on this technology.
- **If the app does not start:** Check Docker is running and ensure you used the correct port forwarding (5000).
- **For AWS issues:** Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured and that you have permissions for EC2.
